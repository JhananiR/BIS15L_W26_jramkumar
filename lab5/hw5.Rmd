## Instructions
Answer the following questions and/or complete the exercises in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push the final work to your repository. Your report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for any included code chunks to run. Any plots must have appropriate titles and aesthetics.  

## Load the tidyverse
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
options(scipen=999) #turn off scientific notation
```

## Data
**Database of vertebrate home range sizes.** 
Reference: Tamburello N, Cote IM, Dulvy NK (2015) Energy and the scaling of animal space use. The American Naturalist 186(2):196-211. http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/682070.  
Data: http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.q5j65/1  

**1. Load the data into a new object called `homerange`.**
```{r}
homerange <- read_csv("Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv")
```

**2. What is the structure of the `homerange` data? Does it have any NA's? Do a quick exploratory analysis of your choice below.**
```{r}
glimpse(homerange)
```

Yes, the data has NA's.

```{r}
names(homerange)
```

**3. Which animal groups are represented in the data? Make a plot that shows the number in each class.**
```{r}
anim_grp <- filter(homerange, class %in% c("actinopterygii", "aves", "mammalia", "reptilia"))
ggplot(data=anim_grp, 
       mapping=aes(x=class))+
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(fill=class))+
  labs(title="# of Animals in Each Animal Group")
```

The animal groups that are represented in the data are actinopterygii, aves, mammalia, and reptilia with mammalia category with the most count. 

**4. Are there more carnivores or herbivores represented in the data? Make a plot that shows the number in each trophic guild.**
```{r}
carn_herb <- filter(homerange, trophic.guild %in% c("carnivore", "herbivore"))
ggplot(data=carn_herb, 
       mapping=aes(x=trophic.guild))+
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(fill=trophic.guild))+
  labs(title="# of Carnivores vs. Herbivores")
```

There are more carnivores than herbivores. 

**5. Which herbivorous mammals have homeranges greater than 1,000,000 m²? Show only the common name, order, mean homerange size, and mean body mass. Arrange the data in descending order by homerange size and show only the top 10 species.**

```{r}
homerange <- homerange[!duplicated (homerange$common.name), ]
```

This code is from https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/identify-and-remove-duplicate-data-in-r/. My dataframe kept duplicating each row. 

```{r}
homerange$mean.hra.m2 <- as.numeric(homerange$mean.hra.m2)
filter(homerange, class == "mammalia", trophic.guild == "herbivore", mean.hra.m2>1000000) %>% 
  select(common.name, order, mean.hra.m2, mean.mass.g) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean.hra.m2)) %>% 
  slice_max(mean.hra.m2, n=10)
```

The top 10 species of herbivorous mammmals with homeranges greater than 1000000 include Reindeer, African Bush Elephant, Greater Kudu, American Bison, Giraffe, Asian Elephant, Moose, Red Deer, Goat, and Common Eland.

**6. Which two species have the largest and smallest homerange sizes?**
```{r}
select(homerange, common.name, mean.hra.m2) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean.hra.m2)) %>% 
  slice_head(n=1)
```

The species with the largest homerange is reindeer with 3550830977 m^2.

```{r}
select(homerange, common.name, mean.hra.m2) %>% 
  arrange(mean.hra.m2) %>% 
  slice_head(n=1)
```

The species with the smallest homerange is Rusty Goby with 0.03 m^2.

**7. Which carnivorous mammals have the largest homeranges?**
```{r}
filter(homerange, class == "mammalia", trophic.guild == "carnivore") %>% 
  select(common.name, order, mean.hra.m2, mean.mass.g) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean.hra.m2))
```

Some carnivorous mammals with the largest homeranges include cheetah, leopard, carcal, wolverine, cougar, and etc.

**8. Is there a relationship between body mass and homerange size? Make a scatterplot to show this relationship. Be sure to include appropriate labels and a title.**
```{r}
homerange$mean.mass.g <- as.numeric(homerange$mean.mass.g)
ggplot(data=homerange, 
       mapping=aes(x=mean.mass.g, y=mean.hra.m2))+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(color=class))+
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=T)+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()+
  labs(title="Body Mass (g) vs. Homerange Size (m^2)", x = "Mean Body Mass (g)", y = "Mean Homerange Sizes (m^2)")
```

There is a strong, positive correlation between body mass and mean homerange sizes. As body mass increases, homerange sizes increases.

**9. Use filter to extract the data for only birds and mammals. Then make a plot that compares the homerange sizes of these two groups. Be sure to include appropriate labels and a title.**
```{r}
birds_mamm <- filter(homerange, class %in% c("aves", "mammalia"))
ggplot(data=birds_mamm, 
       mapping=aes(x=class, y=mean.hra.m2))+
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(fill=class))+
  scale_y_log10()+
  labs(title="Comparison of Homerange Sizes between Birds vs. Mammals", x = "Class", y = "Mean Homerange Size")
```

Comparing the medians, the Mammals have higher homerange sizes compared to the birds.

**10. Do one additional exploratory analysis of your choice. Before writing the code, write the question you are trying to answer. The question should be biologically meaningful and appropriate for the data. It must include at least one `filter()`, `select()`, and `arrange()`.**

Which carnivorous fish species have the smallest body masses? Only list the top 5 species.
```{r}
filter(homerange, class == "actinopterygii", trophic.guild == "carnivore") %>% 
  select(class, common.name, order, mean.mass.g) %>% 
  arrange(mean.mass.g) %>% 
  slice_min(mean.mass.g, n=5)
```

## Knit and Upload
Please knit your work as an .html file and upload to Canvas. Homework is due before the start of the next lab. No late work is accepted. Make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!
